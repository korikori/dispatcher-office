# dispatcher-office
A simple NetworkManager-dispatcher script that is aware of the wireless network you're on.

Based on @justintime's 2008 script (http://sysadminsjourney.com/content/2008/12/18/use-networkmanager-launch-scripts-based-network-location/), the purpose of this dispatcher script is to run specific tasks depending on the ESSID of the wireless network that you are currently connected to. This can automate regular location-based activities at the office or at school.
